NLP-Projects
This repository is a collection of various projects focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating different techniques for understanding, analyzing, and classifying human language. It spans from foundational text processing tasks to advanced deep learning models for complex NLP challenges.

Projects Included:
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger:
A simple Python script utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to tokenize paragraphs and classify words into their respective parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.). This project provides a basic understanding of grammatical tagging in text.

NLP_Text_Classification:
This project covers the end-to-end implementation of text classification tasks using state-of-the-art transformer models, specifically RoBERTa and XLNet. It demonstrates how to load, fine-tune, and evaluate these powerful models for categorizing human emotions from textual data (e.g., Twitter messages), leveraging datasets from the Hugging Face library.

Feel free to explore each project's individual subdirectory for detailed code, documentation, and specific instructions.
